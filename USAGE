renum directory (options)
all files found within given directory will be used unless you give an extension filter.
It does not search directories recursively (for a reason).
The new file names will be created like this: prefix + number + extension
Options:
	-f extension -> filter the files with this extension (for existing filenames) [default is all files]
		 multiple extensions might be used like that: -f .ext1 -f .ext2 ...
	-e extension -> change extension of new filenames (format is .ext) [default is .jpg]
	-p prefix -> prefix of new filenames [default is "image_"]
	-c number -> start counting from this number (for new filenames) [default is 1]
	-d -> do it. PLEASE make ABSOLUTELY sure you know what you're doing [without -d -> it is pretend mode]
		 please note that -d does unrevertable changes, please make sure you have run this exact setup
		 without -d before and you are happy with the outcome and accept the risks.
		 The program does not check about overlapping filenames in any manner -> DATA LOSS might happen!
