== Renumbering the filenames of photos for creating timelapses with ffmpeg ==

This is a very very simple tool for a specific task. It will fail in many situations. It does not work with unicode filenames.

IMPORTANT: DATA LOSS might happen, use only if you HAVE a BACKUP!

Take it AS IS without any warranty!

How it works:

it searches for files within given directory. If no filter is given it will take all files. It does not search directories
recursively though! The files will be sorted alphabetically and then numbered by this scheme: prefix + number + extension.

Once it is done you can run something like: ffmpeg -f image2 -i image_%06d.jpg -r 24 -q:v 2 timelapse.avi

What you need to consider:

* Make sure ALL current file names sort alphabetically in increasing order
* It will not detect if your camera overflew the numbering:
    something like DSC_9998.JPG DSC_9999.JPG DSC_0000.JPG ... -> it will NOT detect that!
    you'd need to create a new directory and put all files upto DSC_9999.JPG, then renum them, then
    put all the rest files into a new directory and renum them with -c option
